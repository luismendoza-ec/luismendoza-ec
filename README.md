## About Me
Hey there! I'm Luis, founder of Scraplay.com and a full-stack developer whoâ€™s always up for a good challenge, whether it's advanced scraping, deobfuscation, system integration, or automation. Basically, if thereâ€™s a reason to code, Iâ€™m in.

I see programming as both an art and a bit of magic. If youâ€™re looking for someone to join your project or need a custom solution, Iâ€™m your guy.

You might not find tons of public code here just yet; Iâ€™ve been working on a lot of private projects. But Iâ€™ll be sharing more with the community soonâ€”stuff that could be handy for a lot of folks.

## Currently Working On
- Custom scraping services.
- A high-demand indexing API.
- TypeWar (an amazing 2D game developed with Godot): [TypeWar in Itch.io](https://luismendoza-ec.itch.io/typewar)
- Particle Life Prototype (An emergent systems simulator written with pure JS): [ParticleLife in Itch.io](https://luismendoza-ec.itch.io/particles-life-prototype)
- Lu8 (My own retro fantasy console): [Lu8 in Itch.io](https://luismendoza-ec.itch.io/lu8) [Lu8 website](https://lu8.dev)
- Plus a few other private projects Iâ€™m supporting.
